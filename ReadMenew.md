AWS Resources
Create an AWS ECS cluster using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.
Create an AWS ECR repository to store your Docker images.
Ensure that the IAM roles and permissions are correctly set up for ECS and ECR.
Bash Script
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Modify the bash_script.sh file to include any custom deployment or configuration steps.
Make the bash_script.sh file executable: chmod +x bash_script.sh.
Terraform
Install Terraform on your local machine.
Open the terraform directory.
Modify the variables.tf file to set the required variables.
Run terraform init to initialize the Terraform configuration.
Run terraform apply to create the necessary AWS resources.
Deployment
Build the Docker image for your Flask application: docker build -t <image-name> ..
Tag the Docker image: docker tag <image-name> <ECR-repository-uri>:<tag>.
Push the Docker image to the ECR repository: docker push <ECR-repository-uri>:<tag>.
Deploy the application to the ECS cluster using the Terraform deployment script.
Usage
Once the deployment is successful, you can access your Flask application using the public endpoint of your ECS service.
Set any necessary environment variables for your application (e.g., database connection details, API keys).
Customize the application as per your requirements.
